# Species classification training

This directory contains a set of scripts for:

- Detecting animals in camera trap images with image-level annotations
- Cropping the detected animals, associating the image-level annotation with the crop
- Collecting all the cropped images as a [COCO Camera Traps](https://github.com/Microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/master/data_management/README.md#coco-cameratraps-format) dataset or as TFRecords
- Training an image classifier on the collected data using TensorFlow's slim library


## Preparing datasets

The scripts need a data set with image-level class annotations in [COCO Camera Traps](https://github.com/Microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/master/data_management/README.md#coco-cameratraps-format) format. We do not need or use bounding box annotations as the
purpose of the scripts is to locate the animals using a detector. [This library](https://patrickwasp.com/create-your-own-coco-style-dataset/)
facilitates the creation of COCO-style data sets.

You can check out [lila.science](http://lila.science) for example data sets. In addition to the standard format, we usually split the camera trap datasets
by locations, i.e. into training and testing locations. Hence it is advisable to have a field in your image annotation specifying the location
as string or integer. This could look like:

    image {
      "id" : int,
      "width" : int,
      "height" : int,
      "file_name" : str,
      "location": str
    }

The corresponding category annotation should contain at least

    annotation {
      "id" : int,
      "image_id" : int,
      "category_id" : int
    }


## Preparing your environment

The scripts use the following libraries:
- TensorFlow
- TensorFlow Object Detection API (TFODAPI)
- pycocotools

All these dependencies should be satisfied if you follow the installation instructions for the [TFODAPI](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/installation.md). You can also use conda for TensorFlow and pycocotools:

     conda install tensorflow-gpu
     conda install -c conda-forge pycocotools

However, you still need to follow the remaining parts of the TFODAPI installation. In particular, keep in mind that you always need to add
relevant paths to your PYTHONPATH variable using:

    # From tensorflow/models/research/
    export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:`pwd`:`pwd`/slim

...before running any of the scripts.


## Animal detection and cropping

The detection, cropping, and dataset generation is done in `data_management/databases/classification/make_classification_dataset.py`. You can run
```python make_classification_dataset.py -h```
for a description of all required parameters.

    usage: make_classification_dataset.py [-h]
                                          [--coco_style_output COCO_STYLE_OUTPUT]
                                          [--tfrecords_output TFRECORDS_OUTPUT]
                                          [--location_key location]
                                          [--exclude_categories EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES [EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES ...]]
                                          [--use_detection_file USE_DETECTION_FILE]
                                          [--padding_factor PADDING_FACTOR]
                                          [--test_fraction TEST_FRACTION]
                                          [--ims_per_record IMS_PER_RECORD]
                                          input_json image_dir frozen_graph

    positional arguments:
      input_json            COCO style dataset annotation
      image_dir             Root folder of the images, as used in the annotations
                            file
      frozen_graph          Frozen graph of detection network as create by
                            export_inference_graph.py of TFODAPI.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --coco_style_output COCO_STYLE_OUTPUT
                            Output directory for a dataset in COCO format.
      --tfrecords_output TFRECORDS_OUTPUT
                            Output directory for a dataset in TFRecords format.
      --location_key location
                            Key in the image-level annotations that specifies the
                            splitting criteria. Usually we split camera-trap
                            datasets by locations, i.e. training and testing
                            locations. In this case, you probably want to pass
                            something like `--location_key location`. The script
                            prints the annotation of a randomly selected image
                            which you can use for reference.
      --exclude_categories EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES [EXCLUDE_CATEGORIES ...]
                            Categories to ignore. We will not run detection on
                            images of that category and will not use them for the
                            classification dataset.
      --use_detection_file USE_DETECTION_FILE
                            Uses existing detections from a file generated by this
                            script. You can use this to continue a partially
                            processed dataset.
      --padding_factor PADDING_FACTOR
                            We will crop a tight square box around the animal
                            enlarged by this factor. Default is 1.3 * 1.3 = 1.69,
                            which accounts for the cropping at test time and for a
                            reasonable amount of context
      --test_fraction TEST_FRACTION
                            Proportion of the locations used for testing, should
                            be in [0,1]. Default: 0.2
      --ims_per_record IMS_PER_RECORD
                            Number of images to store in each tfrecord file


A typical command will look like:

```
python make_classification_dataset.py \
    /path/to/dataset.json \
    /path/to/image/root/ \
    /path/to/frozen/detection/graph.pb \
    --coco_style_output /path/to/cocostyle/output/ \
    --tfrecords_output /path/to/tfrecords/output/ \
    --location_key location \
    --exclude_categories human empty
```

It is generally advisable to generate both the COCO-style and TFRecords output, as the former allows to check the
detection results while the latter is used for classification training. The COCO-style output folder will also contain a
file called `detections_final.pkl`, which will be used to store the complete detection output of all images. This file
can be used as input to the `make_classification_dataset.py` script, which makes sense if you added new images to the
dataset and want to re-use all the detection you have already. Images without any entry in the `detections_final.pkl`
file will be analyzed using the detector.

The script will only add images to the output folders, if they:
- exist in the images folder and can be opened
- have at least one detection with confidence 0.5 or above
- are annotated with exactly one class label (the COCO annotation format allows multiple class labels per image)
- do not exist yet in the output folders (this can happen if you re-run the script with a `detections_final.pkl` file as show above

All other images will be ignored without warning.

The default padding factor is fairly large and optimized for images with only one animal inside and TF-slim based classification.
You might need to adjust it according to the type of data, but keep in mind that the script currently ignores all images
with two or more detections.


## Dataset statistics

The file `data_management/databases/classification/cropped_camera_trap_dataset_statistics.py` can be used to get some statistics about the generated datasets, in particular the number of images and classes. This information will be required later on. The input is the original json file of the camera-trap dataset as well as the `train.json` and `test.json` files, which are located in the generated COCO-style output folder.

The usage of the script is as follows:

    usage: Tools for getting dataset statistics. It is written for datasets generated with the make_classification_dataset.py script.
           [-h] [--classlist_output CLASSLIST_OUTPUT]
           [--location_key LOCATION_KEY]
           camera_trap_json train_json test_json

    positional arguments:
      camera_trap_json      Path to json file of the camera trap dataset from
                            LILA.
      train_json            Path to train.json generated by the
                            make_classification_dataset.py script
      test_json             Path to test.json generated by the
                            make_classification_dataset.py script

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      --classlist_output CLASSLIST_OUTPUT
                            Generates the list of classes that corresponds to the
                            outputs of a network trained with the train.json file
      --location_key LOCATION_KEY
                            Key in the camera trap json specifying the location
                            which was used for splitting the dataset.

This prints all statistics to stdout. You can save the output by redirecting it to a file:

~~~
python cropped_camera_trap_dataset_statistics.py \
    /path/to/dataset.json \
    /path/to/cocostyle/output/train.json \
    /path/to/cocostyle/output/test.json \
    > stats.txt
~~~

It is also useful to save the list of classes, which allows for associating the output of the classification CNN later with
the classes. You can generate this class list by using the `--classlist_output` parameter.

Note: line 31 of `cropped_camera_trap_dataset_statistics.py` might need some adjustments depending on the dataset you
are using. In this line, we collect the list of all locations by getting the COCO-style annotaion for each image that we find
in `train.json` and `test.json`. For each image, we hence have to convert the field `file_name` of `train.json`/`test.json`
to the corresponding key used in the COCO-style annotations.

## Classification training
Once the TFRecords output is generated by `make_classification_dataset.py`, we can prepare the classification training.
Unfortunately, Tensorflow slim requires code adjustments for every new dataset you want to use. Go to the folder
`classification/tf-slim/datasets/` and copy one of the existing camera-trap dataset descriptors, for example `wellington.py`.
We will call the copied file `newdataset.py` and place it in the same folder. The only lines that need adjustment
are the ones specifying the number of training and testing images as well as the number of classes, i.e. line 20 and 22.
These lines look in `wellington.py` like

    SPLITS_TO_SIZES = {'train': 112698, 'test': 24734}

    _NUM_CLASSES = 17

and should be adjusted to the new dataset. If you use the output of the script presented in the previous section, then
you want to use the total number of classes, not the number of non-empty classes.

The second step is connecting the newly generated `newdataset.py` with the Tensorflow slim code. This is done by modifying
`classification/tf-slim/datasets/dataset_factory.py`. You first need to add an import statement `import newdataset` to the top of
the file. Afterward, add an additional dictionary entry to `datasets_map` in line 29. Afterward, it should look similar
to

    datasets_map = {
        'cifar10': cifar10,
        'flowers': flowers,
        'imagenet': imagenet,
        'mnist': mnist,
        'cct': cct,
        'wellington': wellington,
        'new_dataset': new_dataset # This is the newly added line
    }

This concludes the code modifications. The training can be now started using the `train_image_classifier.py` file or one
of the scripts. The easiest way to get started is by copying one of the bash scripts, e.g. `classification/training_scripts/train_well_inception_v4.sh`,
and name the copy according to your dataset, e.g. `classification/training_scripts/train_newdataset_inception_v4.sh`. Now open the script and adjust all
the variables at the top. In particular,

- Assign `DATASET_NAME` the name of the dataset as used in `classification/datasets/dataset_factory.py`, we called it
`new_dataset`in this example.
- Set `DATASET_DIR` to the TFRecords directory created above (we named it `/path/to/tfrecords/output/` in the example)
- Set `TRAIN_DIR` to the log output directory you wish to use. Folders will be created automatically
- Assign `CHECKPOINT_PATH` the path to the pre-trained Inception V4 model. It is available at
`http://download.tensorflow.org/models/inception_v4_2016_09_09.tar.gz`

Now you are ready to run the training. Go to `classification/tf-slim/` and execute your script with `bash ../training_scripts/train_newdataset_inception_v4`.
The provided script trains first only the last layer, executes one evaluation run, then fine-tunes the whole
network, and then runs evaluation again. If everything goes well, the final top-1 and top-5 accuracy should be reported
at the end.

NOTE: It appears that there is a bug in the tf-slim code, which manifests in a significantly lower accuracy, e.g., 10% lower than expected. If you experiences issues with low accuracy values, try the following fix. After the training is finished, locate the created log directory, change the variable `TRAIN_DIR` in `train_serengeti_inception_v4.sh` to this folder. Now re-run `bash ../training_scripts/train_serengeti_inception_v4.sh`. The tensorflow training will recognize the existing checkpoints, read the model, and write out a new bug-free model. Tensorflow sometimes starts the training even if `TRAIN_DIR` is incorrect. So double-check if the training continues from the latest step.


## Model export
Trained models can be exported into a frozen graph, which includes all pre-processing steps and dependencies. This graph takes any image with values in the range `[0,1]` and computes the class scores. Please note that the training code generates a frozen graph as well. However, this graph does not include pre-processing and hence the correct input to this model depends on the architecture.

The export is a two-step process of exporting the architecture as a graph definition file using `classification/export_inference_graph_definition.py` and then fusing this architecture with the learned parameters into a frozen graph using `classification/freeze_graph.py`. Both scripts were adapted from the similarly named scripts provided by Tensorflow.

The scripts should be executed using `CameraTraps/classification/tf-slim` as the current working directory. The syntax of `export_inference_graph_definition.py`  is as follows:

	python ../export_inference_graph_definition.py \
	    --model_name=ARCHITECTURE_NAME
	    --output_file=PATH_TO_OUTPUT_PBTXT
	    --dataset_name=DATASET_NAME
	    --write_text_graphdef=True

	Arguments:
	ARCHITECTURE_NAME     Name of architecture as used in the training script.
	PATH_TO_OUTPUT_PBTXT  Desired output path of the generated pbtxt file.
	DATASET_NAME          Name of the datset as used in the training script.

Once the pbtxt file is generated, the frozen graph can be generated with `freeze_graph.py`. The syntax is

	python ../freeze_graph.py \
	  --input_graph=PATH_TO_OUTPUT_PBTXT
	  --input_checkpoint=PATH_TO_MODEL_CKPT \
	  --output_graph=PATH_TO_OUTPUT_GRAPH \
	  --input_node_names=input \
	  --output_node_names=output \
	  --clear_devices=True

	Arguments:
	PATH_TO_OUTPUT_PBTXT    Path to exported graph definition.
	PATH_TO_MODEL_CKPT      Path to checkpoint, which contains the learned parameters of the classifier.
	PATH_TO_OUTPUT_GRAPH    Desired output file to write the frozen graph to. For example, `./frozen_inference_graph_w_preprocessing.pb`



An example of the usage can be also found in the tutorial as well as in `CameraTraps/classification/export_inference_graph_serengeti.sh`.


## Inference

Inference on new images can be done with one of the following scripts:

- `classification/predict_image.py` performs whole-image classification, i.e. it is suitable for classifying a cropped image containing a single animal
- `classification/detect_and_predict_image.py` applies a generic detector to the input image(s) and classifies each detected box separately.
- `classification/generate_sample_predictions.py` randomly (with constant seed) selects images from the testing set and writes these along with corresponding predictions to a subfolder.

All scripts use frozen graphs for prediction, so you might want to run the export as shown above first. The export allows for using the model without the training code of the `tf-slim` directory.

NOTE: Please make sure you are using the frozen graph generated by our scripts, not the one that the training process automatically generates. Our scripts also add the pre-processing to the frozen graph.

The single-image prediction with `classification/predict_image.py` has the following syntax:

	usage: predict_image.py [-h]
	                        [--frozen_graph PATH_TO_CLASSIFIER_W_PREPROCESSING]
	                        [--classlist CLASSLIST] [--image_path IMAGE_PATH]

	Given a pointer to a frozen detection graph, runs inference on a single image
	and prints results.

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --frozen_graph PATH_TO_CLASSIFIER_W_PREPROCESSING
	                        Frozen graph of detection network as created by the
	                        export_inference_graph_definition.py freeze_graph.py
	                        script. The script assumes that the model already
	                        includes all necessary pre-processing.
	  --classlist CLASSLIST
	                        Path to text file containing the names of all possible
	                        categories.
	  --image_path IMAGE_PATH
	                        Path to image file.

The combined detected and classification script `classification/detect_and_predict_image.py` can be used as follows:

	usage: detect_and_predict_image.py [-h] [--classes_file CLASSES_FILE]
	                                   [--image_dir IMAGE_DIR]
	                                   [--image_file IMAGE_FILE]
	                                   [--threshold THRESHOLD]
	                                   [--num_annotated_classes NUM_ANNOTATED_CLASSES]
	                                   [--recursive]
	                                   PATH_TO_DETECTOR
	                                   PATH_TO_CLASSIFIER_W_PREPROCESSING

	                        values in [0,1], so double check that you use the
	                        correct model. The script
	                        `export_inference_graph_serengeti.sh` shows how to
	                        create such a model

	  --classes_file CLASSES_FILE
	                        File with the class names. Each line should contain
	                        one name and the first line should correspond to the
	                        first output, the second line to the second model
	                        output, etc.

	  --num_annotated_classes NUM_ANNOTATED_CLASSES
	                        Number of classes to annotated for each bounding box,

	Tools for sampling images from the testing split of a dataset and predicting
	results with it.

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --frozen_graph PATH_TO_CLASSIFIER_W_PREPROCESSING
	                        Frozen graph of the classification model, which

	  --output_dir OUTPUT_DIR
	                        Path to output directory. We will copy sample images
	                        to this location and also save the output as text file
	                        here. Default: "./sample_output"
	  --num_samples NUM_SAMPLES
	                        Number of samples to selected. Default: 5

## Remarks and advanced adjustments of training parameters

The parameter `NUM_GPUS` in the training script is currently not used. The batch size and learning rates are optimized
for the Inception V4 architecture and should give good results without any change. However, you might need to adjust the
number of steps, i.e. `--max_number_of_steps=`. One step processed one batch of images, i.e. by default 32 images.
Divide the number of images in your dataset by the batch size and you will obtain the number of steps required for one
epoch, i.e. one pass over the complete training set. While it is enough to train the last layer only one or a few epochs,
fine-tuning the whole network should be done for at least 10 epochs, the more challenging and the larger the dataset,
the longer.

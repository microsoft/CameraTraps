The steps walk through the copying of all of the required model and helper files to the Colab runtime and install all the required packages. You can then connect to your Google Drive folder and process all of the images in a folder using the MegaDetector saved model. The output is in a JSON file - a text based database-like file following the COCO dataset format. The Google Colab instance will only stay open for maximum 10-12 hrs and after that it will close and any unsaved data will be lost. I recommend saving the JSON output back into your Google Drive folder for persistent storage. "

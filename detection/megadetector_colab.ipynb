    "# Running MegaDetector on camera trap images using Google Colab\n",

    "@alsnothome\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference please read the [MegaDetector guide on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/master/megadetector.md) and check there for updates. Here we have roughly followed the steps for running under Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is designed to load camera trap image files already uploaded onto Google Drive. If you don't have images already loaded onto Google Drive or just want to see a demo of MegaDetector in action, we also provide code to download some sample images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps walk through copying of all of the required model and helper files to the Colab runtime and installing all the required packages. You can then connect to your Google Drive folder and process all of the images in a folder using the MegaDetector saved model. The output is saved in a JSON file - a text based database file whose format is described in this [section](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/tree/master/api/batch_processing#batch-processing-api-output-format) in the batch API user guide. The detections (as bounding boxes) can then be rendered on your images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Google Colab instance will only stay open for a maximum 10-12 hrs and after that it will close and any unsaved data will be lost. We recommend saving the JSON output and annotated images into your Google Drive folder for persistent storage."

    "\n",
    "- Select or sort images based on whether they contain animal or people or vehicles.\n",
    "- View bounding boxes during additional manual annotation steps (which may speed up review...)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Subsetting the output JSON into more manageable JSONs to use with Timelapse**\n",
    "\n",
    "People using Timelapse often split up the workload and have multiple Timelapse databases per study. We wrote a simple Windows desktop app ([Camera Trap Batch API Output Manager App](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/master/api/batch_processing/postprocessing/CameraTrapJsonManagerApp.md)) for splitting up the output JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Separating images into folders that contain animals/people/vehicles/nothing\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of our collaborators do their downstream labeling without Timelapse, by moving the images to separate folders containing animals/people/vehicles/nothing according to MegaDetector output. You can use the script [separate_detections_into_folders.py](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/master/api/batch_processing/postprocessing/separate_detections_into_folders.py) to do that if you have some familiarity with running Python scripts. This script has only one external package (\"tqdm\") to install - you can also follow our [installation instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps#initial-setup) to run the script inside a conda virtual environment. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Help me process millions and millions of images\n",
    "\n",
    "We offer a [service](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/tree/master/api/batch_processing#detector-batch-processing-api-user-guide) for processing a large quantity of camera trap images using the MegaDetector. We typically call this service on behalf of ecologist users once their images are uploaded.

        "This notebook is designed to load camera trap image files already uploaded onto Google Drive. The steps walk through the copying of all of the required model and helper files to the Colab runtime and install all the required packages. You can then connect to your Google Drive folder and process all of the images in a folder using the MegaDetector saved model. The output is saved in a JSON file - a text based database file whose format is described in this [section](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/tree/master/api/batch_processing#batch-processing-api-output-format) in the batch API user guide. The detections (as bounding boxes) can then be rendered on your images. The Google Colab instance will only stay open for a maximum 10-12 hrs and after that it will close and any unsaved data will be lost. I recommend saving the JSON output and annotated images into your Google Drive folder for persistent storage. "

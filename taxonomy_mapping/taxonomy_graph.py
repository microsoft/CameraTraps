Methods for transforming taxonomy CSV into a graph structure backed by
NetworkX.

We treat each taxon in the taxonomy as a node in a graph, represented by the
TaxonNode class. We use a NetworkX directed graph (nx.DiGraph) to keep track of
the edges (parent-child relationships) between the nodes.

In theory, the true biological taxonomy graph should be a tree, where every
taxon node has exactly 1 parent. However, because we use both GBIF and INAT
taxonomies, there are 2 situations where a taxon node ends up with two parents.
Thus, the graph is actually a "directed acyclic graph" (DAG) instead of a tree.

The two situations are explained in detail below. This module includes a
function dag_to_tree() which converts a DAG to a tree by heuristically removing
edges from the DAG so that each node only has 1 parent.

CASE 1: INAT and GBIF have different granularity in their taxonomy levels
======
An example is shown below. In dag_to_tree(), the lower parent is kept, while
the higher-up parent is discarded. In this example, the "sciurini -> sciurus"
edge would be kept, while "sciuridae -> sciurus" would be removed.

        "eastern gray squirrel" (inat)     "squirrel" (gbif)
        ------------------------------     -----------------
    family:                        sciuridae
                                  /          \
    subfamily:          sciurinae             |  # skips subfamily
                                |             |
    tribe:               sciurini             |  # skips tribe
                                  \          /
    genus:                          sciurus


CASE 2: INAT and GBIF have different taxonomies
======
An example is shown below. In dag_to_tree(), the resolution to these
discrepancies are hard-coded.

    order:    cathartiformes (inat)     accipitriformes (gbif)
                           \           /
    family:                 cathartidae

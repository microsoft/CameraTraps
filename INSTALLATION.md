# Pytorch-Wildlife: A Collaborative Deep Learning Framework for Conservation

## Welcome to Version 1.0

The **Pytorch-Wildlife** library allows users to directly load the MegadetectorV5 model weights for animal detection. We've fully refactored our codebase, prioritizing ease of use in model deployment and expansion. In addition to `MegadetectorV5`, **Pytorch-Wildlife** also accommodates a range of classification weights, such as those derived from the Amazon Rainforest dataset and the Opossum classification dataset. Explore the codebase and functionalities of **Pytorch-Wildlife** through our interactive `Gradio` web app and detailed Jupyter notebooks, designed to showcase the practical applications of our enhancements. You can find more information in our [documentation](https://cameratraps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Prerequisites
 
1. Python 3.8 
2. NVIDIA GPU for CUDA support (Optional, the code and demo also supports cpu calculation)
3. `conda` or `mamba` for python environment management and specific version of `opencv`.

### Create environment
If you have `conda` or `mamba` installed, you can create a new environment with the following commands (switch `conda` to `mamba` for `mamba` users):
```bash
conda create -n pytorch-wildlife python=3.8 -y
conda activate pytorch-wildlife
```
NOTE: For Windows users, please use the Anaconda Prompt if you are using Anaconda. Otherwise, please use PowerShell for the conda environment and the rest of the set up.

### Ubuntu
If you are using a clean install of Ubuntu, additional libraries of OpenCV may need to be installed, please run the following command:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y python3-opencv
```

### MacOS
If you are using MacOS, please run the following command to install ffmpeg for video decoding:
```bash
brew install ffmpeg
```

## Installation

### Install through pip:
```bash
pip install PytorchWildlife
```

## Running the Demo
Here is a brief example on how to perform detection and classification on a single image using `PyTorch-wildlife`:

```python
import torch
from PytorchWildlife.models import detection as pw_detection
from PytorchWildlife.models import classification as pw_classification

img = torch.randn((3, 1280, 1280))

# Detection
detection_model = pw_detection.MegaDetectorV5() # Model weights are automatically downloaded.
detection_result = detection_model.single_image_detection(img)

#Classification
classification_model = pw_classification.AI4GAmazonRainforest() # Model weights are automatically downloaded.
classification_results = classification_model.single_image_classification(img)
```

If you want to use our Gradio demo for a user-friendly interface. Please run the following code inside the current repo. You can also find Jupyter Notebooks with an image and video tutorial:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps.git
cd CameraTraps
cd demo
# For the image demo
python image_demo.py
# For the video demo
python video_demo.py
# For the gradio app
python demo_gradio.py
```
The `demo_gradio.py` will launch a Gradio interface where you can:
- Perform Single Image Detection: Upload an image and set a confidence threshold to get detections.
- Perform Batch Image Detection: Upload a zip file containing multiple images to get detections in a JSON format.
- Perform Video Detection: Upload a video and get a processed video with detected animals. 

Some browsers may not render processed videos due to unsupported codec. If that happens, please either use a newer version of browser or run the following for a `conda` version of `opencv` and chose `avc1` in the Video encoder drop down menu in the webapp (this might not work for MacOS):

```bash
pip uninstall opencv-python
conda install -c conda-forge opencv
```

**NOTE: Windows may encounter some errors with large file uploads making Batch Image Detection and Video Detection unable to process. It is a Gradio issue. Newer versions of Gradio in the future may fix this problem.**

## MegaDetector overview

Conservation biologists invest a huge amount of time reviewing camera trap images, and &ndash; even worse &ndash; a huge fraction of that time is spent reviewing images they aren&rsquo;t interested in.  This primarily includes empty images, but for many projects, images of people and vehicles are also &ldquo;noise&rdquo;, or at least need to be handled separately from animals.

<i>Machine learning can accelerate this process, letting biologists spend their time on the images that matter.</i>

To this end, this page hosts a model we&rsquo;ve trained to detect animals, people, and vehicles in camera trap images, using several hundred thousand bounding boxes from a variety of ecosystems.  It does not identify animals, it just finds them.  The current model is based on Faster-RCNN with an InceptionResNetv2 base network, and was trained with the TensorFlow Object Detection API.  We use this model as our first stage for classifier training and inference.

## Our ask to MegaDetector users

MegaDetector is free, and it makes us super-happy when people use it, so we put it out there as a downloadable model that is easy to use in a variety of conservation scenarios.  That means we don&rsquo;t know who&rsquo;s using it unless you contact us (or we happen to run into you), so please please pretty-please email us at <a href="mailto:cameratraps@microsoft.com">cameratraps@microsoft.com</a> if you find it useful!


## Downloading the model(s)

### MegaDetector v3, 2019.05.30

#### Release notes

In addition to incorporating additional data, this release adds a preliminary &ldquo;human&rdquo; class.  Our animal training data is still far more comprehensive than our humans-in-camera-traps data, so if you&rsquo;re interested in using our detector but find that it works better on animals than people, stay tuned.

## Using the models 

We provide three ways to apply this model to new images:

- To &ldquo;test drive&rdquo; this model on small sets of images and get super-satisfying visual output, we provide [run_tf_detector.py](https://github.com/Microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/master/detection/run_tf_detector.py), an example script for invoking this detector on new images.  This script doesn&rsquo;t depend on anything else in our repo, so you can download it and give it a try.  [Let us know](mailto:cameratraps@microsoft.com) how it works on your images!
- To apply this model to larger image sets on a single machine, we recommend a slightly different script, [run_tf_detector_batch](https://github.com/Microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/master/detection/run_tf_detector_batch.py).  This outputs data in the same format as our [batch processing API](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/tree/master/api/batch_processing), so you can leverage all of our post-processing tools.
- Speaking of which, when we process loads of images from collaborators, we use our [batch processing API](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/tree/master/api/batch_processing), which we can make available externally on request.  [Email us](mailto:cameratraps@microsoft.com) for more information.

## Tell me more about why detectors are a good first step for camera trap images

Can do!  See these &ldquo;<a href="http://dmorris.net/misc/cameratraps/ai4e_camera_traps_overview">slides</a>&rdquo;.

## Pretty picture

Here&rsquo;s a &ldquo;teaser&rdquo; image of what detector output looks like:

## Can you share the training data?

This model is trained on bounding boxes from a variety of ecosystems, and many of the images we use in training are not publicly-shareable for license reasons.  We do train in part on bounding boxes from two public data sets:

- [Caltech Camera Traps](http://lila.science/datasets/caltech-camera-traps)
- [Snapshot Serengeti](http://lila.science/datasets/snapshot-serengeti)

...so if our detector performs really well on those data sets, that&rsquo;s great, but it&rsquo;s a little bit cheating, because we haven&rsquo;t published the set of locations from those data sets that we use during training.

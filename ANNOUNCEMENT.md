### Pytorch-Wildlife Version 1.2.0
- In this version of Pytorch-Wildlife, we are happy to release our [detection fine-tuning module](PW_FT_detection), with which users can fine-tune their own detection model from any released pre-trained MegaDetectorV6 models. Besides, this module also has functionalities that help users to prepare their datasets for the fine-tuning, just as our classification fine-tuning modules. For more details, please check the [readme](PW_FT_detection/README.md). Currently the fine-tuning is based on [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com/) with AGPL. We will release MIT versions in the future. Here is the [release page](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/releases).
- We have also released additional MegaDetectorV6 models based on Yolo-v10 and RtDetr. We have skipped Yolo-v11 models because of limited performance and architectural gains. Most of the MIT and Apache versions have also finished training but are waiting for internal review before they can be released.
- We have also updated our AI4G-Amazon model with bigger datasets and it has a better performance compared to previous iterations. Please feel free to test it or fine-tune on it. 
- We will also make a new roadmap for 2025 in the next couple of updates.
- Special thanks to [José Díaz](https://github.com/jdiaz97) for his great cross-platform app, [BoquilaHUB](https://github.com/boquila/boquilahub), that is even working on ios and android! Please check his repo out! In the future, we will create a project gallery showcasing projects that use or are build upon Pytorch-Wildlife.

# Labeling Tool for Species Classification with Active Learning
> Web interface for labeling species in camera trap images

This web interface allows users to annotate cropped images for training a species classification model with active learning. Built with [`bottle`](https://bottlepy.org/docs/dev/).

## Setup
1. Create an `images` folder containing full-size camera trap images, which may be in 
nested directories.

2. (Required if COCO bounding-box annotations are not available, otherwise optional.) Use `run_tf_detector_batch.py` to get predicted bounding boxes in an `detector_output.csv` file.

3. Create a `crops` folder containing cropped images either obtained from COCO 
bounding-box annotations (from running `crop_images_from_coco_bboxes.py` in 
`data_preprocessing`) or from bounding boxes predicted by a detector 
(`crop_images_from_batch_api_detections.py`). These scripts also create a 
`crops.json` file in the `crops` folder that contains information about each cropped 
image and its source file.

4. Create a text file listing the classes to use while labeling the species, put it in
labeling_tool/class_lists.

5. Initialize a PostgreSQL database and populate it using `initialize_target_db.py` 
in `Database`.

## Usage
Determine which host and which port you will use to serve the web app. e.g.
* Serve the app locally. In this case you should provide `runapp.py` with the CLI arguments `--host localhost` and `--port [ANY PORT NUMBER YOU CHOOSE]`. In Line 243 of `labeling_tool/static/html/index.html` you should change the urlPrefix to `http://localhost:[SPECIFIED PORT NUMBER]`.
* Serve the app on a remote VM. In this case you should provide `runapp.py` with CLI arguments `--host 0.0.0.0` and `--port [PORT YOU HAVE INBOUND CONNECTIONS FOR]`. In Line 243 of `labeling_tool/static/html/index.html` you should change urlPrefix to the DNS name or IP address of the VM, along with the exposed port number. 
 
```bash
cd labeling_tool

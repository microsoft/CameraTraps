## Features

- Pre-trained models for animal detection and classification.
- Data transformations for preprocessing.
- Gradio interface for quick and user-friendly demonstrations.
- Extensive documentation and tutorials for different use cases.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.x
2. NVIDIA GPU (for CUDA support, although the demo can run on CPU)

## Installation

### 1. Install through pip:
```bash
pip install PyTorchWildlife
```

## Running the Demo

Once the setup is complete, execute:

```bash
python demo_gradio.py
```

This will launch a Gradio interface where you can:

- Perform Single Image Detection: Upload an image and set a confidence threshold to get detections.
- Perform Batch Image Detection: Upload a zip file containing multiple images to get detections in a JSON format.
- Perform Video Detection: Upload a video and get a processed video with detected animals.

# Pytorch-Wildlife models are available with AddaxAI (formerly EcoAssist)!
We are thrilled to announce our collaboration with [AddaxAI](https://addaxdatascience.com/addaxai/#spp-models)---a powerful user interface software that enables users to directly load models from the PyTorch-Wildlife model zoo for image analysis on local computers. With AddaxAI, you can now utilize MegaDetectorV5 and the classification models---AI4GAmazonRainforest and AI4GOpossum---for automatic animal detection and identification, alongside a comprehensive suite of pre- and post-processing tools. This partnership aims to enhance the overall user experience with PyTorch-Wildlife models for a general audience. We will work closely to bring more features together for more efficient and effective wildlife analysis in the future. Please refer to their tutorials on how to use Pytorch-Wildlife models with AddaxAI.

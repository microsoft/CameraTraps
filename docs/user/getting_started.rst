Getting Started with PytorchWildlife
====================================

Introduction
------------

PytorchWildlife is a collaborative deep learning framework developed for the conservation community. It offers pre-trained models tailored for animal detection and classification, making it easier for researchers, conservationists, and enthusiasts to harness the power of machine learning for wildlife monitoring and research.

Installation
------------

Before you begin, ensure that you have Python 3.x installed, and if you're looking to use GPU acceleration, make sure you have an NVIDIA GPU available.

To install the PyTorchWildlife package, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install PyTorchWildlife

This will fetch the latest version of the package from PyPI and install it on your system.

Tutorials
---------

To help you get hands-on with the package, we provide detailed tutorials that walk you through various functionalities of PytorchWildlife:

3. **Gradio Interface**: Dive into an interactive demo using Gradio, which provides a user-friendly interface for quick demonstrations. [Link to the tutorial](./demo/gradio_demo.ipynb)

We recommend starting with the Gradio Interface tutorial for out-of-the-box inference and then progressing to the others as you become more familiar with the package.

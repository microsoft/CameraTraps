# snapshot_safar_importer_reprise.py

# This is a 2023 update to snapshot_safari_importer.py.  We do a bunch of things now that
# we didn't do the last time we imported Snapshot data (like updating the big taxonomy)
# file, and we skip a bunch of things now that we used to do (like generating massive
# zipfiles).  So, new year, new importer.

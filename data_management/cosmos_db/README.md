# Cosmos database

We would like to centralize all COCO Camera Trap (CCT) format json databases containing image metadata and species/bounding box annotations into an instance of a Cosmos DB for easier management and querying. We refer to this database as the MegaDB. 

- `make_embedded_db.py` converts a json database in the CTT format to an embedded/denormalized format, so that the image metadata and annotations on image are both within the image entry. It actually takes the image database and bounding box database json files when these are separate.
 
    - Be very careful to make sure the `dataset_name` parameter to this script (first positional argument) is set properly - bulk updating entries is very slow! 
    
    - You can then insert these entries in bulk using the [data migration tool](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/import-data) (Windows only). Need to leave both the Partition Key and the ID fields blank, and uncheck "suppress ID generation". 
    
    - Each dataset's metadata stored (each dataset's data is one partition) cannot exceed [10GB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/concepts-limits).

- `useful_queries.ipynb` is a collection of queries in SQL syntax for common operations such as getting images with a certain species, recently inserted images, and images with bounding box annotations. It also shows how to connect to the database using the Python SDK.

    - Documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/create-sql-api-python

- `query_for_data.ipynb` is a notebook demonstrating the end-to-end workflow of querying the metadata of the images using the MegaDB for relevant entries, and retrieving them from blob storage.


### TODO 

-[ ] Migrate all CCT databases there for datasets that have their images stored unzipped in Blob Storage

-[ ] Create an additional table for dataset metadata (currently in `datasets.json`)

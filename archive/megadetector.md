# Announcement
 
At the core of our mission is the desire to create a harmonious space where conservation scientists from all over the globe can unite, share, and grow. We are expanding the CameraTraps repo to introduce **Pytorch-Wildlife**, a Collaborative Deep Learning Framework for Conservation, where researchers can come together to share and use datasets and deep learning architectures for wildlife conservation.
 
We've been inspired by the potential and capabilities of Megadetector, and we deeply value its contributions to the community. **As we forge ahead with Pytorch-Wildlife, under which Megadetector now resides, please know that we remain committed to supporting, maintaining, and developing Megadetector, ensuring its continued relevance, expansion, and utility.**

To use the newest version of MegaDetector with all the exisitng functionatlities, you can use our newly developed [user interface](#explore-pytorch-wildlife-and-megadetector-with-our-user-interface) or simply load the model with **Pytorch-Wildlife** and the weights will be automatically downloaded:

```python
from PytorchWildlife.models import detection as pw_detection
detection_model = pw_detection.MegaDetectorV5()
```

If you'd like to learn more about **Pytorch-Wildlife**, please continue reading.

For those interested in accessing the previous MegaDetector repository, which utilizes the same `MegaDetector v5` model weights and was primarily developed by Dan Morris during his time at Microsoft, please visit the [archive](./archive) directory, or you can visit this [forked repository](https://github.com/agentmorris/MegaDetector/tree/main) that Dan Morris is actively maintaining.
 
**If you have any questions regarding MegaDetector and Pytorch-Wildlife, please <a href="mailto:zhongqimiao@microsoft.com">email us</a>!**

## MegaDetector overview

Conservation biologists invest a huge amount of time reviewing camera trap images, and a huge fraction of that time is spent reviewing images they aren't interested in.  This primarily includes empty images, but for many projects, images of people and vehicles are also "noise", or at least need to be handled separately from animals.

*Machine learning can accelerate this process, letting biologists spend their time on the images that matter.*

To this end, this page hosts a model we've trained - called "MegaDetector" - to detect animals, people, and vehicles in camera trap images.  It does not identify animals to the species level, it just finds them.  

This page is about the technical elements of MegaDetector; if you are an ecologist looking to use MegaDetector, you may prefer to start at our ["Getting started with MegaDetector"](collaborations.md) page.


## Our ask to MegaDetector users

MegaDetector is free, and it makes us super-happy when people use it, so we put it out there as a downloadable model that is easy to use in a variety of conservation scenarios.  That means we don't know who's using it unless you contact us (or we happen to run into you), so please please pretty-please email us at [cameratraps@lila.science](mailto:cameratraps@lila.science) if you find it useful!


## How fast is MegaDetector, and can I run it on my giant/small computer?

We often run MegaDetector on behalf of users as a free service; see our ["Getting started with MegaDetector"](collaborations.md) page for more information.  But there are many reasons to run MegaDetector on your own; how practical this is will depend in part on how many images you need to process and what kind of computer hardware you have available.  MegaDetector is designed to favor accuracy over speed, and we typically run it on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit">GPU</a>-enabled computers.  That said, you can run anything on anything if you have enough time, and we're happy to support users who run MegaDetector on their own GPUs (in the cloud or on their own PCs), on their own CPUs, or even on embedded devices.  If you only need to process a few thousand images per week, for example, a typical laptop will be just fine.  If you want to crunch through 20 million images as fast as possible, you'll want at least one GPU.

Here are some rules of thumb to help you estimate how fast you can run MegaDetector on different types of hardware.

* On a decent laptop (without a fancy deep learning GPU) that is neither the fastest nor slowest laptop you can buy in 2023, MegaDetector v5 can process somewhere between 25,000 and 50,000 images per day.  This might be totally fine for scenarios where you have even hundreds of thousands of images, as long as you can wait a few days.
* On a dedicated deep learning GPU that is neither the fastest nor slowest GPU you can buy in 2023, MegaDetector v5 can process between 300,000 and 1,000,000 images per day.  We include a few <a href="#benchmark-timings">benchmark timings</a> below on some specific GPUs.

We don't typically recommend running MegaDetector on embedded devices, although <a href="https://www.electromaker.io/project/view/whats-destroying-my-yard-pest-detection-with-raspberry-pi">some folks have done it</a>!  More commonly, for embedded scenarios, it probably makes sense to use MegaDetector to generate bounding boxes on lots of images from your specific ecosystem, then use those boxes to train a smaller model that fits your embedded device's compute budget.

### Benchmark timings

These results are based on a test batch of around 13,000 images from the public <a href="https://lila.science/datasets/snapshot-karoo">Snapshot Karoo</a> and <a href="http://lila.science/datasets/idaho-camera-traps/">Idaho Camera Traps</a> datasets.  These were chosen to be "typical", and anecdotally they are, though FWIW we have seen very high-resolution images that run around 30% slower than these, and very low-resolution images (typically video frames) that run around 100% faster than these.</i>

Some of these results were measured by "team MegaDetector", and some are user-reported; YMMV.  
  
#### Timing results for MDv5

* An <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3090-3090ti/">RTX 3090</a> processes around 11.4 images per second, or around 985,000 images per day (for MDv5)
* An <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3080-3080ti/">RTX 3080</a> processes around 9.5 images per second, or around 820,800 images per day (for MDv5)
* An <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3050/">RTX 3050</a> processes around 4.2 images per second, or around 363,000 images per day (for MDv5)
* A <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/content/dam/en-zz/Solutions/design-visualization/productspage/quadro/quadro-desktop/quadro-pascal-p2000-data-sheet-us-nvidia-704443-r2-web.pdf">Quadro P2000</a> processes around 2.1 images per second, or around 180,000 images per day (for MDv5)
* A 2020 M1 MacBook Pro (8 GPU cores) averages around 1.85 images per second, or around 160,000 images per day (for MDv5)
* An Intel Core i7-12700 CPU (on a 2022 mid-range HP desktop) processes around 0.5 images per second on a single core (43,000 images per day) (multi-core performance is... complicated) (for MDv5)

#### Timing results for MDv4

FWIW, MDv5 is consistently 3x-4x faster than MDv4, so if you see a device listed here and want to estimate MDv5 performance, assume 3x-4x speedup.

* An <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/v100/">NVIDIA V100</a> processes around 2.79 images per second, or around 240,000 images per day (for MDv4)
* An <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/30-series/rtx-3090/">NVIDIA RTX 3090</a> processes ~3.24 images per second, or ~280,000 images per day (for MDv4)
* An <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/rtx-2080-ti/">NVIDIA RTX 2080 Ti</a> processes ~2.48 images per second, or ~214,000 images per day (for MDv4)
* An <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/20-series/">NVIDIA RTX 2080</a> processes ~2.0 images per second, or ~171,000 images per day (for MDv4)
* An <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/graphics-cards/rtx-2060-super/">NVIDIA RTX 2060 SUPER</a> processes ~1.64 images per second, or ~141,000 images per day (for MDv4)
* An <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/titan/titan-v/">NVIDIA Titan V</a> processes ~1.9 images per second, or ~167,000 images per day (for MDv4)
* An <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-Quadro-T2000-Laptop-Graphics-Card.423971.0.html">NVIDIA Titan Quadro T2000</a> processes ~0.64 images per second, or ~55,200 images per day (for MDv4)

 #### Contributing to this benchmark list
 
If you want to run this benchmark on your own, here are <a href="https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/blob/master/download_megadetector_timing_benchmark_set.bat">azcopy commands</a> to download those 13,226 images, and we're happy to help you get MegaDetector running on your setup.  Or if you're using MegaDetector on other images with other GPUs, we'd love to include that data here as well.  <a href="mailto:cameratraps@lila.science">Email us</a>!

### User-reported timings on other data

Speed can vary widely based on image size, hard drive speed, etc., and in these numbers we're just taking what users report without asking what the deal was with the data, so... YMMV.

* A GTX 1080 processed 699,530 images in 1:20:22:00 through MDv5 (4.37 images per second, or ~378,000 images per day)
* An RTX 3050 processes ~4.6 images per second, or ~397,000 images per day through MDv5
* An RTX 3090 processes ~11 images per second, or ~950,000 images per day through MDv5

## Downloading the model

### MegaDetector v5.0, 2022.06.15

#### Release notes

This release incorporates additional training data, specifically aiming to improve our coverage of:

* Boats and trains in the "vehicle" class
* Artificial objects (e.g. bait stations, traps, lures) that frequently overlap with animals
* Rodents, particularly at close range
* Reptiles and small birds

This release also represents a change in MegaDetector's architecture, from Faster-RCNN to [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5).  Our inference scripts have been updated to support both architectures, so the transition should be <i>mostly</i> seamless.

MDv5 is actually two models (MDv5a and MDv5b), differing only in their training data (see the [training data](#can-you-share-the-training-data) section for details).  Both appear to be more accurate than MDv4, and both are 3x-4x faster than MDv4, but each MDv5 model can outperform the other slightly, depending on your data.  Guidelines about which to start with are TBD; we will work with the community to develop these guidelines over the next few months.  When in doubt, for now, try them both.  If you really twist our arms to recommend one... we recommend MDv5a.  But try them both and tell us which works better for you!

See the [release page](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/releases/tag/v5.0) for more details, and in particular, be aware that the range of confidence values produced by MDv5 is very different from the range of confidence values produced by MDv4!  <i>Don't use your MDv4 confidence thresholds with MDv5!</i>

### MegaDetector v4.1, 2020.04.27

#### Release notes

This release incorporates additional training data from Borneo, Australia and the [WCS Camera Traps](http://lila.science/datasets/wcscameratraps) dataset, as well as images of humans in both daytime and nighttime. We also have a preliminary "vehicle" class for cars, trucks, and bicycles.

If you're not sure which format to use, you want the "frozen model" file (the first link).

### MegaDetector v3, 2019.05.30

#### Release notes

In addition to incorporating additional data, this release adds a preliminary "human" class.  Our animal training data is still far more comprehensive than our humans-in-camera-traps data, so if you're interested in using our detector but find that it works better on animals than people, stay tuned.

## Using the model

### Overview

We provide two ways to apply this model to new images:

1. A simple test script that makes neat pictures with bounding boxes, but doesn't produce a useful output file ([run_detector.py](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/blob/master/detection/run_detector.py))

2. A script for running large batches of images on a local GPU ([run_detector_batch.py](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/blob/master/detection/run_detector_batch.py))

Also see the <a href="#is-there-a-gui">&ldquo;Is there a GUI?&rdquo;</a> section for graphical options and other ways of running MD, including real-time APIs, Docker environments, and other goodies.

The remainder of this section provides instructions for running our "official" scripts, including installing all the necessary Python dependencies.

### 1. Install prerequisites: Anaconda, Git, and NVIDIA stuff

All of the instructions that follow assume you have installed [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).  Anaconda is an environment for installing and running Python stuff.

The instructions will also assume you have git installed.  If you're not familiar with git, and you are on a Windows machine, we recommend installing [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

The instructions will assume you are running at an Anaconda prompt.  You will know you are at an Anaconda prompt (as opposed to run-of-the-mill command prompt) if you see an environment name in parentheses before your current directory, like this:

<img src="images/anaconda-prompt-base.jpg" style="margin-left:25px;">

...or this:

<img src="images/anaconda-prompt-ct.jpg" style="margin-left:25px;">

On Windows, when you install Anaconda, you will actually get two different Anaconda command prompts; in your start menu, they will be called "Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3)" and "Anaconda Powershell Prompt (anaconda3)".  These instructions assume you are using the "regular" Anaconda prompt, <b>not</b> the Powershell prompt.

If you have a deep-learning-friendly GPU, you will also need to have a recent [NVIDIA driver](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx) installed. 


### 2. Download the MegaDetector model(s)

Download one or more MegaDetector model files ([MDv5a](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/releases/download/v5.0/md_v5a.0.0.pt), [MDv5b](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/releases/download/v5.0/md_v5b.0.0.pt), and/or [MDv4](https://lilablobssc.blob.core.windows.net/models/camera_traps/megadetector/md_v4.1.0/md_v4.1.0.pb)) to your computer.  These instructions will assume that you have downloaded MegaDetector to a folder called "c:\megadetector" (on Windows) or to a folder called "megadetector" within your home folder (on Linux/Mac), but if you put it somewhere else, that's fine, just be sure to change it in the steps below that point to a model file.  If you don't care where it goes, and you don't know yet which version you want to use, you'll have an easier time working through these instructions if you download [MDv5a](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/releases/download/v5.0/md_v5a.0.0.pt) to those folders, i.e. if the model file lives at "c:\megadetector\md_v5a.0.0.pt" (on Windows) or "/Users/your-user-name/megadetector/md_v5a.0.0pt" (on Mac).

The instructions below will assume that you are using MDv5a; one step will be slightly different for MDv4, but we'll call that out when we get there.


### 3. Clone the relevant git repos and add them to your path, and set up your Python environment

You will need the contents of three git repos to make everything work: this repo, the associated [ai4eutils](https://github.com/microsoft/ai4eutils) repo (some useful file management utilities), and - if you are running MegaDetector v5 - the [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) repo (more specifically, a fork of that repo).  You will also need to set up an Anaconda environment with all the Python packages that our code depends on.

In this section, we provide <a href="#windows-instructions-for-gitpython-stuff">Windows</a>, <a href="#linux-instructions-for-gitpython-stuff">Linux</a>, and <a href="#mac-instructions-for-gitpython-stuff">Mac</a> instructions for doing all of this stuff.


#### Windows instructions for git/Python stuff

The first time you set all of this up, open an Anaconda Prompt, and run:

```batch
mkdir c:\git
cd c:\git
git clone https://github.com/ecologize/yolov5/
git clone https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/ai4eutils
cd c:\git\cameratraps
conda env create --file environment-detector.yml
conda activate cameratraps-detector
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;c:\git\CameraTraps;c:\git\ai4eutils;c:\git\yolov5
```

If you want to use MDv4, there's one extra setup step (this will not break your MDv5 setup, you can run both in the same environment):

```batch
conda activate cameratraps-detector
pip install tensorflow
```

<a name="windows-new-shell"></a>
Your environment is set up now!  In the future, when you open an Anaconda prompt, you only need to run:

```batch
cd c:\git\cameratraps
conda activate cameratraps-detector
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;c:\git\CameraTraps;c:\git\ai4eutils;c:\git\yolov5
```

Pro tip: if you have administrative access to your machine, rather than using the "set PYTHONPATH" steps, you can also create a permanent PYTHONPATH environment variable.  Here's a [good page](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm) about editing environment variables in Windows.  But if you just want to "stick to the script" and do it exactly the way we recommend above, that's fine.


#### Linux instructions for git/Python stuff

If you have installed Anaconda on Linux, you are probably always at an Anaconda prompt; i.e., you should see "(base)" at your command prompt.  Assuming you see that, the first time you set all of this up, and run:

```batch
mkdir ~/git
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/ecologize/yolov5/
git clone https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/ai4eutils
cd ~/git/cameratraps
conda env create --file environment-detector.yml
conda activate cameratraps-detector
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/git/CameraTraps:$HOME/git/ai4eutils:$HOME/git/yolov5"
```

If you want to use MDv4, there's one extra setup step (this will not break your MDv5 setup, you can run both in the same environment):

```batch
conda activate cameratraps-detector
pip install tensorflow
```

<a name="linux-new-shell"></a>
Your environment is set up now!  In the future, whenever you start a new shell, you just need to do:

```batch
cd ~/git/cameratraps
conda activate cameratraps-detector
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/git/CameraTraps:$HOME/git/ai4eutils:$HOME/git/yolov5"
```

Pro tip: rather than updating your PYTHONPATH every time you start a new shell, you can add the "export" line to your .bashrc file.


#### Mac instructions for git/Python stuff

These are instructions for <i>Intel</i> Macs; see <a href="#regarding-m1-mac-support">below</a> for a note on M1 Mac support.

If you have installed Anaconda on Linux, you are probably always at an Anaconda prompt; i.e., you should see "(base)" at your command prompt.  Assuming you see that, the first time you set all of this up, and run:

```batch
mkdir ~/git
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/ecologize/yolov5/
git clone https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/ai4eutils
cd ~/git/cameratraps
conda env create --file environment-detector-mac.yml
conda activate cameratraps-detector
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/git/CameraTraps:$HOME/git/ai4eutils:$HOME/git/yolov5"
```

If you want to use MDv4, there's one extra setup step (this will not break your MDv5 setup, you can run both in the same environment):

```batch
conda activate cameratraps-detector
pip install tensorflow
```

<a name="linux-new-shell"></a>
Your environment is set up now!  In the future, whenever you start a new shell, you just need to do:

```batch
cd ~/git/cameratraps
conda activate cameratraps-detector
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/git/CameraTraps:$HOME/git/ai4eutils:$HOME/git/yolov5"
```

Pro tip: rather than updating your PYTHONPATH every time you start a new shell, you can add the "export" line to your .bashrc file.

##### Regarding M1 Mac support

M1 Macs are not officially supported right now, but with a bit of work, you can not only run MegaDetector on an M1 Mac, you can even use the M1 for accelerated inference.  Details about doing this are on <a href="https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/issues/297">this issue</a>.  YMMV.


### 4. Hooray, we finally get to run MegaDetector!

#### run_detector.py

To test MegaDetector out on small sets of images and get super-satisfying visual output, we provide [run_detector.py](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/blob/master/detection/run_detector.py), an example script for invoking this detector on new images.  This isn't how we recommend running lots of images through MegaDetector (see [run_detector_batch.py](#2-run_detector_batchpy) below for "real" usage), but it's a quick way to test things out.  [Let us know](mailto:cameratraps@lila.science) how it works on your images!

The following examples assume you have an Anaconda prompt open, and have put things in the same directories we put things in the above instructions.  If you put things in different places, adjust these examples to match your folders, and most importantly, adjust these examples to point to your images.

To use run_detector.py on Windows, when you open a new Anaconda prompt, don't forget to do this:

```batch
cd c:\git\CameraTraps
conda activate cameratraps-detector
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;c:\git\CameraTraps;c:\git\ai4eutils;c:\git\yolov5
```

Then you can run the script like this:

```batch
python detection\run_detector.py "c:\megadetector\md_v5a.0.0.pt" --image_file "some_image_file.jpg" --threshold 0.1
```

Change "some_image_file.jpg" to point to a real image on your computer.

If you ran this script on "some_image_file.jpg", it will produce a file called "some_image_file_detections.jpg", which - if everything worked right - has boxes on objects of interest.

If you have a GPU, and it's being utilized correctly, near the beginning of the output, you should see:

`GPU available: True`

If you have an Nvidia GPU, and it's being utilized correctly, near the beginning of the output, you should see:

`GPU available: True`

If you have an Nvidia GPU and you see "GPU available: False", your GPU environment may not be set up correctly.  95% of the time, this is fixed by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/">updating your Nvidia driver"</a> and rebooting.  If you have an Nvidia GPU, and you've installed the latest driver, and you've rebooted, and you're still seeing "GPU available: False", <a href="mailto:cameratraps@lila.science">email us</a>.


<b>This is really just a test script, you will mostly only use this to make sure your environment is set up correctly</b>.  run_detector_batch.py (see <a href="#run_detector_batchpy">below</a>) is where the interesting stuff happens.

You can see all the options for this script by running:

```batch
python detection\run_detector.py
```

To use this script on Linux/Mac, when you open a new Anaconda prompt, don't forget to do this:
 
```batch
cd ~/git/cameratraps
conda activate cameratraps-detector
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/git/cameratraps:$HOME/git/ai4eutils:$HOME/git/yolov5"
```

Then you can run the script like this:

```batch
python detection/run_detector.py "$HOME/megadetector/md_v5a.0.0.pt" --image_file "some_image_file.jpg" --threshold 0.1
```

Don't forget to change "some_image_file.jpg" to point to a real image on your computer.

#### run_detector_batch.py

To apply this model to larger image sets on a single machine, we recommend a different script, [run_detector_batch.py](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/blob/master/detection/run_detector_batch.py).  This outputs data in the same format as our [batch processing API](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/tree/master/api/batch_processing), so you can leverage all of our post-processing tools.  The format that this script produces is also compatible with [Timelapse](https://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/).

To use run_detector_batch.py on Windows, when you open a new Anaconda prompt, don't forget to do this:

```batch
cd c:\git\CameraTraps
conda activate cameratraps-detector
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;c:\git\CameraTraps;c:\git\ai4eutils;c:\git\yolov5
```

Then you can run the script like this:

```batch
python detection\run_detector_batch.py "c:\megadetector\md_v5a.0.0.pt" "c:\some_image_folder" "c:\megadetector\test_output.json" --output_relative_filenames --recursive --checkpoint_frequency 10000 --quiet
```

Change "c:\some_image_folder" to point to the real folder on your computer where your images live.

This will produce a file called "c:\megadetector\test_output.json", which - if everything worked right - contains information about where objects of interest are in your images.  You can use that file with any of our [postprocessing](api/batch_processing/postprocessing) scripts, but most users will read this file into [Timelapse](https://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/).

You can see all the options for this script by running:

```batch
python detection\run_detector_batch.py
```

#### Saving and restoring run_detector_batch.py checkpoints

If you are running very large batches, we strongly recommend adding the `--checkpoint_frequency` option to save checkpoints every N images (you don't want to lose all the work your PC has done if your computer crashes!).  10000 is a good value for checkpoint frequency; that will save the results every 10000 images.  This is what we've used in the example above.  When you include this option, you'll see a line in the output that looks like this:

`The checkpoint file will be written to c:\megadetector\checkpoint_20230305232323.json`

The default checkpoint file will be in the same folder as your output file; in this case, because we told the script to write the final output to c:\megadetector\test_output.json, the checkpoint will be written in the c:\megadetector folder.  If everything goes smoothly, the checkpoint file will be deleted when the script finishes.  If your computer crashes/reboots/etc. while the script is running, you can pick up where you left off by running exactly the same command you ran the first time, but adding the "--resume_from_checkpoint" option, with the checkpoint file you want to resume from.  So, in this case, you would run:

```batch
python detection\run_detector_batch.py "c:\megadetector\md_v5a.0.0.pt" "c:\some_image_folder" "c:\megadetector\test_output.json" --output_relative_filenames --recursive --checkpoint_frequency 10000 --quiet --resume_from_checkpoint "c:\megadetector\checkpoint_20230305232323.json"
```

You will see something like this at the beginning of the output:

`Restored 80000 entries from the checkpoint`

If your computer happens to crash *while* a checkpoint is getting written... don't worry, you're still safe, but it's a bit outside the scope of this tutorial, so just <a href="mailto:cameratraps@lila.science">email us</a> in that case.


#### If your GPU isn't recognized by run_detector_batch.py

If you have an Nvidia GPU, and it's being utilized correctly, near the beginning of the output, you should see:

`GPU available: True`

If you have an Nvidia GPU and you see "GPU available: False", your GPU environment may not be set up correctly.  95% of the time, this is fixed by <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/drivers/">updating your Nvidia driver"</a> and rebooting.  If you have an Nvidia GPU, and you've installed the latest driver, and you've rebooted, and you're still seeing "GPU available: False", <a href="mailto:cameratraps@lila.science">email us</a>.

#### Slightly modified run_detector_batch.py instructions for Linux/Mac

To use this script on Linux/Mac, when you open a new Anaconda prompt, don't forget to do this:
 
```batch
cd ~/git/cameratraps
conda activate cameratraps-detector
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/git/CameraTraps:$HOME/git/ai4eutils:$HOME/git/yolov5"
```

Then you can run the script like this:

```batch
python detection/run_detector_batch.py "$HOME/megadetector/md_v5a.0.0.pt" "/some/image/folder" "$HOME/megadetector/test_output.json" --output_relative_filenames --recursive --checkpoint_frequency 10000
```


## OK, but is that how the MD devs run the model?

Almost... we run a lot of MegaDetector on a lot of images, and in addition to just running the main "run_detector_batch" script described in the previous section, running a large batch of images also usually includes:

* Dividing images into chunks for running on multiple GPUs
* Making sure that the number of failed/corrupted images was reasonable
* Eliminating frequent false detections using the [repeat detection elimination](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/tree/main/api/batch_processing/postprocessing/repeat_detection_elimination) process
* Visualizing the results using [postprocess_batch_results.py](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/blob/main/api/batch_processing/postprocessing/postprocess_batch_results.py) to make "results preview" pages like [this one](https://lila.science/public/snapshot_safari_public/snapshot-safari-kar-2022-00-00-v5a.0.0_0.200/)

...and, less frequently:

* Running a species classifier on the MD crops
* Moving images into folders based on MD output
* Various manipulation of the output files, e.g. splitting .json files into smaller .json files for subfolders
* Running and comparing multiple versions of MegaDetector

There are separate scripts to do all of these things, but things would get chaotic if we ran each of these steps separately.  So in practice we almost always run MegaDetector using [manage_local_batch.py](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/blob/main/api/batch_processing/data_preparation/manage_local_batch.py), a script broken into cells for each of those steps.  We run this in an interactive console in [Spyder](https://github.com/spyder-ide/spyder), but we also periodically export this script to a [notebook](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/blob/main/api/batch_processing/data_preparation/manage_local_batch.ipynb) that does exactly the same thing.

So, if you find yourself keeping track of lots of steps like this to manage large MD jobs, try the notebook out!  And let us know if it's useful/broken/wonderful/terrible.

 
## Is there a GUI?

Not exactly... most of our users either use our Python tools to run MegaDetector or have us run MegaDetector for them (see [this page](collaborations.md) for more information about that), then most of those users use [Timelapse](https://saul.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/timelapse/) to use their MegaDetector results in an image review workflow.

But we recognize that Python tools can be a bit daunting, so we're excited that a variety of tools allow you to run MegaDetector in a GUI.  We're interested in users' perspectives on all of these tools, so if you find them useful - or if you know of others - [let us know](mailto:cameratraps@lila.science)!

### Tools for running MegaDetector locally

* [EcoAssist](https://github.com/PetervanLunteren/EcoAssist) is a GUI-based tool for running MegaDetector (supports MDv5) and running some postprocessing functions (e.g. folder separation)
* [CamTrap Detector](https://github.com/bencevans/camtrap-detector) is a GUI-based tool for running MegaDetector (supports MDv5)
* [MegaDetector-GUI](https://github.com/petargyurov/megadetector-gui) is a GUI-based tool for running MegaDetector in Windows environments (MDv4 only as far as we know)


### Interactive demos/APIs

* [Hendry Lydecker](https://github.com/hlydecker) set up a [Hugging Face app](https://huggingface.co/spaces/hlydecker/MegaDetector_v5) for running MDv5
* [Ben Evans](https://bencevans.io/) set up a [Web-based MegaDetector demo](https://replicate.com/bencevans/megadetector) at [replicate.com](https://replicate.com)

### Cloud-based platforms that leverage MegaDetector

It's not quite as simple as "these platforms all run MegaDetector on your images", but to varying degrees, all of the following online platforms use MegaDetector:

* [Wildlife Insights](https://wildlifeinsights.org/)
* [TrapTagger](https://wildeyeconservation.org/trap-tagger-about/)
* [WildTrax](https://www.wildtrax.ca/)
* [Camelot](https://camelotproject.org/)
* [WildePod](https://wildepod.org/)
* [wpsWatch](https://wildlifeprotectionsolutions.org/wpswatch/)
* [Animl](https://animl.camera/) ([code](https://github.com/tnc-ca-geo/animl-frontend)) (different from [this other tool called Animl](https://github.com/conservationtechlab/animl))
* [Cam-WON](https://wildlifeobserver.net/)
* [Zooniverse ML Subject Assistant](https://subject-assistant.zooniverse.org/#/intro)

### Other ways of running MegaDetector that don't fit easily into one of those categories

#### Third-party, YMMV

* [FastAPI/Streamlit package for serving MD and visualizing results](https://github.com/abhayolo/megadetector-fastapi)
* [SpSeg](https://github.com/bhlab/SpSeg/) (pipeline for running MD along with a custom classifier)
* [Animl](https://github.com/conservationtechlab/animl) (R package for running MDv4) ([on rdrr](https://rdrr.io/github/conservationtechlab/animl/f/README.md)) (not to be confused with [this other tool that uses MD](https://animl.camera/), also called Animl)
* [MegaDetectorLite](https://github.com/timmh/MegaDetectorLite) is a set of scripts to convert MDv5 into ONNX and TensorRT formats for embedded deployments.
* [Docker environment](https://github.com/zaandahl/megadetector) for running MDv5
* [pip-installable wrapper](https://github.com/bencevans/camtrapml) for MegaDetector (and other camera-trap-related models)
* [Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/evmans/train-megadetector-tutorial) for fine-tuning MegaDetector to add additional classes

#### Maintained within this repo

* [Batch processing API](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/tree/master/api/batch_processing) that runs images on many GPUs at once on Azure.  There is no public instance of this API, but the code allows you to stand up your own endpoint.
* [Colab notebook](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/blob/master/detection/megadetector_colab.ipynb) ([open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/master/detection/megadetector_colab.ipynb)) for running MDv5 on images stored in Google Drive.
* [Real-time MegaDetector API using Flask](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/tree/main/api/synchronous).  This is deployed via Docker, so the Dockerfile provided for the real-time may be a good starting point for other Docker-based MegaDetector deployments as well.
 

## What if I just want to run non-MD scripts from this repo?

If you want to run scripts from this repo, but you won't actually be running MegaDetector, you can install a lighter-weight version of the same environment by doing the following:

1. Install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).  Anaconda is an environment for installing and running Python stuff.
2. Install git. If you're not familiar with git, we recommend installing git from git-scm ([Windows link](https://git-scm.com/download/win)) ([Mac link](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)).

The remaining steps will assume you are running at an Anaconda prompt.  You will know you are at an Anaconda prompt (as opposed to run-of-the-mill command prompt) if you see an environment name in parentheses before your current directory, like this:

<img src="images/anaconda-prompt-base.jpg" style="margin-left:25px;">

...or this:

<img src="images/anaconda-prompt-ct.jpg" style="margin-left:25px;">

On Windows, when you install Anaconda, you will actually get two different Anaconda command prompts; in your start menu, they will be called "Anaconda Prompt (anaconda3)" and "Anaconda Powershell Prompt (anaconda3)".  These instructions assume you are using the "regular" Anaconda prompt, <b>not</b> the Powershell prompt.

3. In an Anaconda prompt, run the following to create your environment (on Windows):

```batch
mkdir c:\git
cd c:\git
git clone https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/ai4eutils
cd c:\git\cameratraps
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate cameratraps-detector
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;c:\git\CameraTraps;c:\git\ai4eutils
```

...or the following (on MacOS):

```batch
mkdir ~/git
cd ~/git
git clone https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/ai4eutils
cd ~/git/cameratraps
conda env create --file environment-detector-mac.yml
conda activate cameratraps-detector
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/git/CameraTraps:$HOME/git/ai4eutils"
```

4. Whenever you want to start this environment again, run the following (on Windows):

```batch
cd c:\git\cameratraps
conda activate cameratraps-detector
set PYTHONPATH=%PYTHONPATH%;c:\git\CameraTraps;c:\git\ai4eutils
```

...or the following (on MacOS):

```batch
cd ~/git/cameratraps
conda activate cameratraps-detector
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:$HOME/git/CameraTraps:$HOME/git/ai4eutils"
```

Also, the environment file we use here ([environment.yml](environment.yml)) doesn't get quite the same level of TLC that our MegaDetector environment does, so if anyone tries to run scripts that don't directly involve MegaDetector using this environment, and packages are missing, [let us know](mailto:cameratraps@lila.science).

## How do I use the results?

See the ["How do people use MegaDetector results?"](https://github.com/ecologize/CameraTraps/blob/main/collaborations.md#how-people-use-megadetector-results) section of our "getting started" page.


## Have you evaluated MegaDetector's accuracy?

Internally, we track metrics on a validation set when we train MegaDetector, but we can't stress enough how much performance of any AI system can vary in new environments, so if we told you "99.9999% accurate" or "50% accurate", etc., we would immediately follow that up with "but don't believe us: try it in your environment!"

Consequently, when we work with new users, we always start with a "test batch" to get a sense for how well MegaDetector works for <i>your</i> images.  We make this as quick and painless as possible, so that in the (hopefully rare) cases where MegaDetector will not help you, we find that out quickly.

All of those caveats aside, we are aware of some external validation studies... and we'll list them here... but still, try MegaDetector on your images before you assume any performance numbers!

If you know of other validation studies that have been published, [let us know](mailto:cameratraps@lila.science)!

P.S. Really, don't trust results from one ecosystem and assume they will hold in another. [This paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/html/Beery_Recognition_in_Terra_ECCV_2018_paper.html) is about just how catastrophically bad AI models for camera trap images <i>can</i> fail to generalize to new locations.  We hope that's not the case with MegaDetector!  But don't assume.

## Can you share the training data?

This model is trained on bounding boxes from a variety of ecosystems, and many of the images we use in training can't be shared publicly.  But in addition to the private training data we use, we also use many of the bounding boxes available on lila.science:

<https://lila.science/category/camera-traps/>

Each version of MegaDetector uses all the training data from the previous version, plus a bunch of new stuff.  Specifically...

MegaDetector v2 was trained on... actually, we don't remember, that was before the dawn of time.

MegaDetector v3 was trained on private data, plus public data from:

* [Caltech Camera Traps](https://lila.science/datasets/caltech-camera-traps)
* [Snapshot Serengeti](https://lila.science/datasets/snapshot-serengeti)
* [Idaho Camera Traps](https://lila.science/datasets/idaho-camera-traps/)

MegaDetector v4 was trained on all MDv3 training data, plus new private data, and new public data from:

* [WCS Camera Traps](https://lila.science/datasets/wcscameratraps)
* [NACTI (North American Camera Trap Images)](https://lila.science/datasets/nacti)
* [Island Conservation Camera Traps](https://lila.science/datasets/island-conservation-camera-traps)

MegaDetector v5b was trained on all MDv4 training data, plus new private data, and new public data from:

* [Orinoquía Camera Traps](https://lila.science/orinoquia-camera-traps/)
* [SWG Camera Traps](https://lila.science/datasets/swg-camera-traps)
* [ENA24](https://lila.science/datasets/ena24detection)
* [Wellington Camera Traps](https://lila.science/datasets/wellingtoncameratraps)
* [Several datasets from Snapshot Safari](https://lila.science/category/camera-traps/snapshot-safari/)

MegaDetector v5a was trained on all MDv5b training data, and new public data from:

* The [iNaturalist Dataset 2017](https://github.com/visipedia/inat_comp/tree/master/2017)
* [COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home)

So if MegaDetector performs really well on those data sets, that's great, but it's a little bit cheating, because we haven't published the set of locations from those data sets that we use during training.

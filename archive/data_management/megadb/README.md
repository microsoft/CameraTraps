# MegaDB

Internally we store all labels and metadata associated with each image sequence in an Azure Cosmos (NoSQL) database for easy querying.

The database allows for any properties to be associated at the sequence, image, and bounding box levels.

We do not enforce a taxonomy for animal class / species labels: the original labels provided by the organization are kept, with minor typo and consistency corrections.

The resulting database allows for queries such as:
- get all the publicly released images with the class label "bear" in sequences of length greater than 2
- get all images in the dataset "caltech" with one or more bounding boxes
- get the newest 1000 images ingested into the database
- get a list of all species in the database

All images are stored (unzipped) in blob storage, so we can download individual images identified by a query to form a training set.


## Format

The following illustrates what items in the `sequences`, `datasets` and `splits` tables look like. The formal schema, required fields, and constraints on allowed values are specified in `schema/sequences_schema.json` and `schema/datasets_schema.json` and the associated `schema_check.py` scripts.

`sequences` table

```
[
    {
        # required
        "dataset": str,
        "seq_id": str,
        "images": [
            {
                # required
                "file": str (path to the image file at prefix in the storage container of this dataset)
                
                # required if "class" not present on the sequence
                "class": [str]
                
                # optional
                "frame_num": int,
                "datetime": datetime str
                
                "bbox": [
                    {
                        "category": str, one of "animal", "person" or "vehicle",
                        "bbox": [
                            x_min,  # float, relative coordinates. (x_min, y_min) is the upper-left corner
                            y_min,
                            width_box,
                            height_box
                        ]
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
        
        # optional
        "location": str or int,
        
        # required if "class" not present on the images
        "class": [str]

    }
]

```


`datasets` table

```
[
    {
        "dataset_name": str
        "storage_account": str,
        "container": str,
        "path_prefix": str,
        "container_sas_key": str, e.g. "?se=2021-01-01T07%3A59%3A00Z&sp=rl&sv=2018-03-28&sr=c&sig=a_long_string"
        "access": [str],
        "comment": str,
        "rights_holder": str (if the same across all sequences in this dataset)
    }
]
```

`splits` table

```
[
    {
        "dataset": str,
        "train": list of str or int or other hashable obj,
        "val": same,
        "test": same
    }
]
```


## Structure

There are three tables in this database: 

- `sequences`
Each item in this list is a `sequence` object. 

- `datasets`
This table stores information about each dataset in the database. Each dataset object contains information on where in blob storage its images are stored, including any path prefix, its public access status, and any other dataset-level properties.

- `splits`
Each item in this list stores the train/val/test split over location for a dataset. This split is used from MDv4 onwards. 


## Conventions

While most of the enforceable rules are included in the schema `sequences_schema.json` and the extra checks in `sequences_schema_check.py`, we observe a number of additional conventions detailed here. Some rules enforced by the schema and additional checks are explained here also.

### Which level to associate a property
We always associate a property with the highest level in the hierachy that is still correct:
- If the `rights_holder` is the same across a dataset, this property should be on the dataset object in the `datasets` table.
- If `class`, usually used for species or other fine animal categories, is labeled on sequences, this property should be at the `sequence` level, not the `image` level. 


### Sequence information
- For images whose sequence information is unknown, each image is contained in a sequence object whose `seq_id` will start with `dummy_`.
- Use the `frame_num` property to sort images in a sequence. The order of the image objects in the list is usually *incorrect*.
- `frame_num` values need to be unique within a sequence, but do not need to be consecutive. The min value for `frame_num` is 0 even though most start at 1.
- The `location` property can be a string, an int, or a serializable object (e.g. latitude/longitude).


### Images
- Images in a sequence are stored in the `images` field.
- We do not store the height and width of the images
    - All bounding box and other coordinate annotations are stored in relative coordinates.
    
#### Empty images
- The one `class` where we do enforce a "taxonomy": all images that are labeled as emtpy of objects of interest should have its `class` property be a list with only the "empty" label. Do not use "blank", "nothing", etc. 


### Bounding box labels for images
- Bounding boxes are stored in the `bbox` field in an image object. The coordinates in the `bbox` sub-field is `[x_min, y_min, width_box, height_box]`, the upper-left corner of the box and its width and height, all relative to the width and height of the image.
- If an image was sent for annotation but was determined to be empty, the image entry will still have a `bbox` field that points to an empty list. We save this information as a more reliable "empty" label.


### Class labels
- The database we have is intended for *labeled* images, but in some datasets it makes sense to keep subsets of images that do not have labels. For those, their `class` property will be a list with one item `__label_unavailable`. This is different from "unidentified", which often means the animal present is unidentifiable to the finer category.
- Since we have this special keyword for unavailable labels, each sequence OR all images in a sequence should have the `class` property.
- Items in `class` need to be *lower-cased* strings of ASCII characters only (for allowable characters see regex specified in the schema). To convert to ASCII characters, use

```python
from unidecode import unidecode

class_item_to_use = unidecode("p√®re david's rock squirrel")
# will be converted to "pere david's rock squirrel"
```



## Future

### Videos
- When we have video data, it will be added as a property of the sequence object at the same level as `images`.

### More properties associated with each class
- We will create another table `classes` that will associate a `class` property value with additional fields, for each dataset.

# Setting up Windows Remote Desktop 

This guide documents how to set up Window Virtual Machines (VMs) on Azure and add users to them. This could be useful for distributing image labeling tasks using e.g. Timelapse to other team members.

If you would like to more thoroughly understand the VM creation process, head over to the [Create a Windows virtual machine in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/create-windows-virtual-machine-in-azure/) tutorial on Microsoft Learn.

Where not noted, it is fine to accept the default value provided by Azure Portal. The screenshot relevant to a series of steps is shown below the text.

## What is a virtual machine?

A virtual machine is a computer simulated by software to have the same functionality as a physical computer. A VM in Azure is such a simulated computer that runs on a physical computer in an Azure data center. As a user, you can treat a VM as you would a normal computer. 

To access this VM, we use the same mechanism as for accessing any computer in a remote location, which is "remote desktop." This is a type of software run on your local computer that transmits the graphical user interface of the remote computer to you. 


## Create a Windows VM on Azure Portal

Visit Azure Portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com). This is where you can manage the resources in your Azure subscription. Authenticate with your credentials associated with the subscription.

On the menu on the left (if hidden, expand by clicking on the hamburger icon), select the first option "Create a resource".

On the subsequent interface, find the "Compute" category under "Azure Marketplace." Then, click on "Virtual  machine".

### VM settings

On the subsequent "Create a virtual machine" page, in the "Basic" tab (default), select the Subscription that you will use for this VM. Then under the dropdown for "Resource group", click on "Create new" to create a Resource Group for this VM and the other Azure resources that will be created automatically to support it. Give this new Resource Group a name. We name our VMs after animals, so here we call this Resource Group "badger_vm_rg". Fill in the name of the VM in the next textbox (here it is "badger").

Next we choose a "Region" to deploy this VM to. It is very important that you *select the same Region as where you have stored your data* so that data can be read quickly.

![screenshot of top part of the Create a virtual machine page](images/vm_3_subscription_and_name.png)

The "Image" option specifies the operating system that your VM will use; we recommend selecting one of the "Windows 10 Pro" options from the dropdown.

You can leave the Size selection to the default or select a more/less powerful computer to suit your workload. You can change this after the VM is deployed too. 

In the "Administrator account" section, choose a username and password. You will need this later to log in to the VM and set up other users' accounts. 

In the "Inbound port rules" section, make sure you check the "Allow selected ports" radio button and check "RDP" in the dropdown below that. This allows you to access the VM using remote desktop (RDP: Remote Desktop Protocol). 

Once you're happy with the settings, proceed to click on "Review + create." You should not need to modify options in the other tabs besides "Basic."

![screenshot of bottom part of the Create a virtual machine page](images/vm_4_image_size_port.png)

The Portal then takes a few seconds to validate your settings and will show a "Validation passed" message once it finishes. You can then click on "Create." 

You will be taken to a new page that shows the progress of creating various resources to support the VM and the VM itself. This may take a few minutes. 

Once the VM has been created, you can find its "home page" by selecting "Virtual machines" on the menu on the left and choose its entry. If you don't have "Virtual machines" as an option on the menu, search "virtual machine" in the search bar at the top of the Portal's page. You can also directly search for the name of the VM in the search bar to access its home page.


## Connect to the VM

You can manage the VM from its home page. At the top of the Overview page, you will find buttons to Stop and Start the VM. When you're not using the VM, you can stop ("deallocate") it so that your subscription does not get charged. You *don't* need to delete the VM - deleting it means that you need to go through the creation process above next time.

Now click on the "Connect" button to open a side panel. 

![screenshot of the top portion of the VM's home page](images/vm_5_vm_homepage.png)

On this side panel, under the "RDP" tab (default), click on "Download RDP File" to download a .rdp text file.

![screenshot of the Connect popup where you can download the RDP file](images/vm_6_connect_popup.png)


You will then need the "Microsoft Remote Desktop" application on your local computer to access the VM (available for free from Microsoft Store [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-remote-desktop/9wzdncrfj3ps?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) and the Mac App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/microsoft-remote-desktop/id714464092)). 

Once installed, double clicking on the RDP file should get the application started, from which you can operate the VM.

In the Windows Security window, select "More choices" and then "Use a different account". Enter the admin username and password you created above, and then click OK.

You may receive a certificate warning during the sign-in process. Click "Yes" or "Continue" to create the connection.


### Optional: make the IP address of the VM static

The IP address of the VM is by default dynamic and can change over time (especially after re-starts). When this happens, the RDP file will become outdated and you need to download a new one to continue. If you don't want to deal with this, you can set the IP address to be static:

1. On the VM's home page, select the "Networking" setting section. Then, click on the public IP address (indicated by arrow in the screenshot below).

![screenshot of the networking overview page](images/vm_7_networking.png)

2. In the subsequent interface, select "Configuration" from the menu on the left, and check the "Static" radio button instead. Remember to click on the "Save" button above to record this change.

![screenshot of the networking configuration page](images/vm_8_static_ip.png)

After making this change, any RDP files you then download should remain valid. 


## Add additional users

Once you are able to operate the VM using Microsoft Remote Desktop, you can add additional users to the VM as you can on any Windows computer. Here is a [guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026923/windows-10-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account).

As with any Windows 10 Pro computer, the VM can only be operated on by one user at a time.  If this is a significant limitation, we can help you get set up with a Windows Server VM instead (more powerful, slightly less familiar); <a href="mailto:cameratraps@microsoft.com">email us</a> if you want more information about using Windows Server.


## Install Azure Storage Explorer for data access

You can now go ahead to install applications such as Timelapse on the VM and download the results generated by our API. To access the camera trap images on the VM, you need to download them from Azure Blob Storage (these images were previously uploaded so that the batch processing API could access them). You can use Azure Storage Explorer to do that (download from [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/)). 

Once you have it installed, you will be prompted to "Connect to Azure Storage," which you can do by signing into your Azure Account or through a shared access signature (SAS) URI that we provide you with, depending on where your data is stored.

You should be able to browse the images in a blob storage container and select folders to download to the VM.


## Add additional disks to your VM

The default VM includes only a fairly small disk (usually 127GB), probably not large enough to hold your images.  In this section, we'll tell you how to add a data disk.  Note that the size of the disk is unrelated to the "size" option you selected when creating your VM; that "size" refers to the amount of CPU and memory that your VM has, and you can change that any time without re-creating the VM.

To add a new disk to your VM:

1. Open the Azure Portal, click on "Virtual Machines" on the left, then click on the VM you want to add a disk to:

<img src="images/select_vm.jpg" width=650/><br/>

2. This will bring up a list of resources related to this VM; click "disks":

<img src="images/select_disk.png" width=650/><br/>

3. This will bring up a list of disks available on the VM; click "add data disk":

<img src="images/add_disk.png" width=650/><br/>

4. An empty combo box will appear in your list of disks; click the down arrow, and select "Create disk":

<img src="images/create_disk_dropdown.png" width=400/><br/>

5. This will bring up the "Create managed disk" dialog.  Type a reasonable name into the "name" dialog... if you think this disk will only ever be used with this VM, it's convenient to give it a similar name; if you may move it among VMs, you may want to name it according to the related content.  Then click "change size":

<img src="images/create_managed_disk_dialog.png" width=650/><br/>

6. Choose a <i>type</i> and <i>size</i> for your disk.  Type can be - from cheapest (slowest) to most expensive (fastest) - "Standard HDD", "Standard SSD", and "Premium SSD".  Not all VM types can use "Premium SSD" drives.  Pricing and speed information are available <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/managed-disks/">here</a>.  In general, when we create disks that will be several TB in size and last a long time, we use HDDs (cheaper, slower); when we create disks that are short-lived or small, we use SSDs (more expensive, faster).  HDDs in particular are very cheap, so it's often very convenient to create HDDs of several TB if you'll be working with large image collections.  Click "OK" after selecting a size, then click "create".

7. This will take you back to the list of disks for your VM.  You have created a disk at this point, but not actually attached it to your VM.  Click "save" to attach it to your VM:

<img src="images/create_disk_save.png" width=450/><br/>

8. Now you've created a disk and attached it to your VM; this is just like sticking a physical hard drive into a physical computer; the last step is to format the disk.  Connect to your VM over Remote Desktop as per above, hit "control-escape" to bring up the start menu, and type "format disk"; you should see "create and format hard disk partitions" come up in the menu.  Click that choice.  This will bring up the disk manager, which will immediately prompt to you "initialize" the disk.  Click "OK":

<img src="images/initialize_disk.png" width=450/><br/>

9. Now scroll down to the last disk, which will show as "unallocated".  Right-click on this disk and select "new simple volume", which will bring up the "new volume" wizard.  Click OK on all the steps in this wizard, which will create and format your disk.  Your disk should now be available in Windows.<br/><br/>Note that there's sometimes some slightly quirky behavior at the end of this Wizard, where you've finished formatting the disk, and you close all the disk management stuff, and a window pops up that says "you need to format the disk in drive whatever: before you can use it".  You can click "cancel" if this window pops up; you've already done this.

### Alternatives to creating a data disk

Now that we've explained how to add a data disk, which is <i>usually</i> the right way to create more space for working on camera trap projects, we'll also provide a quick rundown of <i>alternatives</i> to creating new disks.

* You can <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/expand-os-disk">expand the size of your operating system disk</a>.  Creating a new disk is usually preferred because (a) often you will use a faster, more expensive type of disk for your operating system than you want to use for your large data disk, and (b) you may later want to move your data disk from one VM to another.

* You can store your images in <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/storage/blobs/">Azure Blob Storage</a> and "mount" that storage (i.e., make it appear as a drive in Windows).  This is really useful when many people need to access the same data, and you don't want to copy it to many computers; furthermore, blob storage is generally less expensive than drives.  However, blob storage is also generally slower than attached drives, and mounted drives can have quirky behavior when it comes to using certain tools, most notably database tools, so this approach is incompatible with some software that needs to read and write to a database near your images, most notably Timelapse.  That said, if you want to use this approach for other image management tasks, we recommend <a href="https://rclone.org/">rclone</a> as a free solution for mounting Azure Blob storage (and all kinds of other storage) as a drive in Windows.
